of the individual; hence we have to be always be proactive in this particular domain. Money plays a

not covered under the insurance then it will become a pretty tough financial situation for that 
individual. The companies in the medical insurance also want to reduce their risk by optimizing the 
insurance cost, because we all know a healthy body is in the hand of the individual only. If individual 
eat healthy and do proper exercise the chance of getting ill is drastically reduced
